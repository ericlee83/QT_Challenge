# Airport Finder

AirportFinder application consumes the Qantas JSON API and allows the consumer to list and filter airports
by country, airport code, international, domestic airports.

AirportFinder exposes two end points for listing and filtering airports.

1. /rest/airports : It lists all the airports information based on the Qantas JSOM API.

```
e.g. get all Australian airport
/rest/airports
```

2. /rest/airports/filters : It filters the airports by the condition given via the URL. Now the service can take following four key words: countryCode, airportCode, internationalAirport and regionalAirport.


```
e.g. get all Australian airports

/rest/airports/filters?countryCode=AU
```
```
e.g. get all Australian international airports

/rest/airports/filters?countryCode=AU&internationalAirport=true
```
```
e.g. get all Australian regional airports

/rest/airports/filters?countryCode=AU&regionalAirport=true
```
```
e.g. get get Sydney airport

/rest/airports/filters?airportCode=SDY
```

This application breaks down into three layers. 

Controller layer contains all the end point and basic validations of input parameters. It also converts inputs into filter strategies. 

On service layer it applies filters on the airport list and returns filter result. 

On domain layer it has all POJOs required in the Qantas Json API.

The filter strategy is created and applied based on inputs. Currently it contains airportCodeFilter, airportContryCodeFilter, airportInternationalfilter and airportRegionalFilter.
